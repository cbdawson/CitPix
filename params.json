{"name":"Citpix","tagline":"Collaboratively-developed open source, free app to post photo & standardized metadata to social media platforms as part of citizen-science projects","body":"###Overview\r\nMany citizen science projects collect volunteer photos via social media. However, for projects that require exact locations and time/date, consistent and accurate reporting can be a problem. For example, some social media platforms such as Twitter, strip image exif data, requiring volunteers to compile and add that information manually.\r\n\r\nThis San Francisco Science Hack Day proposal is to develop a simple, free application citizen science projects can have participants use to post photos to social media channels. The app would automatically extract image exif data and post it in a consistent, standardized approach.\r\n\r\nThis app could be used by King Tides Project volunteers as well as any other interested citizen science projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContact @cbdawson (on gitihub or twitter) for more info.

This is going to be a collaborative project, and everyone's input -- from ideas to coding, helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n![San Francisco Bay waters at edge of I-80 highway as cars drive by](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxLjElouX4KZT3JmV2hMU1ZVNjQ/view?usp=sharing)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
